## Week 1: Game Selection Phase 1

**Overview:**  
During Week 1, our team began by exploring and collecting a diverse set of game inspirations. We aimed to design a game that harks back to classic titles while introducing fresh twists and challenges. Each team member contributed at least two existing game ideas along with a unique twist and potential development challenges.

**Actions Taken:**  
- **Research & Documentation:**  
  - Researched many games from various genres (classic, arcade, puzzle, sports, and strategy) and listed them in our GitHub repo.  
  - For each game, we added notes on what makes it engaging and identified potential technical or creative challenges.
- **Ranking & Discussion:**  
  - Ranked the ideas by suitability and team interest to help narrow down our options for further prototyping.

|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|Puck Power Clash Classic | A fast-paced air hockey game where two players score by hitting a puck into the opponentâ€™s goal. Twist: Incorporates random powerups and dynamic obstacles that alter the game field in real time. Challenges: Realistic physics, collision detection, sound integration, and multiplayer sync.|
|Ring Toss Classic        | Players toss rings aiming to land on targets for points. Twist: Introduce moving targets, interactive buttons to adjust ring height, and obstacles that change ring trajectories. Challenges: Fine-tuning collision and physics, and interactive target mechanics.                             |
|Bounce Classic           | Navigate a red ball through levels filled with obstacles. Twist: Levels feature different terrains such as water, wind, and ice that affect ball movement. Challenges: Hard coding multiple maps and implementing varied physics properties.                                                   |
|Flappy Bird Classic      | Tap to navigate a bird through gaps between pipes. Twist: Incorporate different weather conditions (wind, rain) and powerups that affect flight dynamics. Challenges: Developing diverse movement mechanics based on weather effects.                                                          |
|Crossy Road Classic      | Guide a character across busy roads and obstacles. Twist: The character is pushed into new environments by moving vehicles, adding extra layers of challenge. Challenges: Designing adaptive environments and programming a wide range of obstacle behaviors.                                  |
|Tower Defence Classic    | Defend a territory by placing defensive structures to stop waves of enemies. Twist: Towers are upgraded not by weapons but by adding gems that grant unique abilities based on the combination used. Challenges: Generating enemy wave functions and complex tower upgrades.                   |
