## Week 2: Paint Prototype and Setting Up Jira

**Overview:**  
This week, our team focused on laying the technical groundwork. We developed a simple drawing app (similar to Microsoft Paint) using p5.js to get familiar with our primary development tools and to demonstrate our capability to deploy working apps.

**Actions Taken:**  
- **Paint Prototype:**  
  - Created a basic drawing app that allows freehand drawing, color selection, erase and save the drawing.  
  - Below is the link for the Paint app

- **Project Management (Jira) Setup:**  
  - Set up a new project in Jira to serve as our central agile backlog.  
  - Configured a Jira board to track tasks, sprints, and team progress.  

**Outcome:**  
We validated our technical stack and established essential project management workflows for the rest of the project.
