## Week 3: Game Selection Phase 2 â€“ Two Prototype Ideas

**Overview:**  
In Week 3, we refined our game concepts from Week 1 by focusing on two potential prototypes: **Puck Power Clash** (our air hockey game with powerups and obstacles) and the **Ring Toss Game** with interactive mechanics.

**Actions Taken:**  
- **Paper Prototypes:**  
  - Developed detailed paper prototypes for both game ideas.  
  - Created sketches, recorded short video demonstrations, and gathered inspiration images.
- **Documentation:**  
  - Uploaded all prototypes, videos, images, and initial ideas to our GitHub repository.  
  - Updated the team page with our names, a team photo, and the complete list of game inspirations.  
- **Discussion:**  
  - Conducted meetings to discuss the creative potential and development challenges of each idea.  
  - After weighing pros and cons, our discussion leaned in favor of the **Puck Power Clash** concept.

**Outcome:**  
We narrowed our focus to two strong prototypes, preparing for deeper requirements and refinement in the coming weeks.
