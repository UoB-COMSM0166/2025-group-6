## Week 4: Requirements, Epics, and User Stories

**Overview:**  
This week, we formalized our project requirements by documenting all necessary elements and planning our future development. We defined our stakeholders, created epics, and developed detailed user stories that outline the vision and functionality of our game.

**Actions Taken:**  
- **Stakeholder Identification:**  
  - Compiled a list of stakeholders (players, designers, developers, testers) and added it to our GitHub requirements section.
- **Epics & User Stories:**  
  - Developed high-level epics (e.g., "basic game mechanics and core game play", "Dynamic Sound Integration", "responsive and advanced graphics") and detailed user stories for core features such as realistic physics, UI responsiveness, and interactive feedback.  
  - Examples include user stories for natural puck collisions and interactive scoring feedback.
- **Reflective Documentation:**  
  - Reflection on Epics, User Stories, and Acceptance Criteria

Our journey through defining epics, user stories, and acceptance criteria has been instrumental in shaping the development roadmap for “Puck Power Clash.” These agile techniques provided a structured approach that ensured our team maintained a clear vision while breaking down complex features into manageable tasks.
Starting with epics allowed us to capture high-level requirements from both the player’s and product owner’s perspectives. Epics like "As a player, I want basic game mechanics and core gameplay" and "As a player, I want a fully immersive audio experience" established the foundation for our game’s functional and experiential needs. Similarly, epics directed at the product owner—such as ensuring different game screens and robust technical documentation—helped clarify our priorities and stakeholder expectations.
Transitioning from epics to user stories enabled us to translate these broad goals into detailed, actionable requirements. User stories provided narratives that captured the user's needs in context. For instance, the story "As a player, I need powerups in the game based on points scored or streaks" allowed us to focus on specific gameplay enhancements while considering their implications for game balance and engagement. Each user story was accompanied by acceptance criteria, which served as a checklist to verify that every feature met the expected standards. These criteria have guided our development process, ensuring that our features are both testable and verifiable.
In summary, the process of creating epics, user stories, and acceptance criteria has improved our team communication and clarified our objectives, aligning our development efforts with the game’s context. By breaking the project into clear, prioritized components, we are better prepared to tackle challenges effectively and deliver a cohesive, engaging, and technically robust game experience. This structured approach ensures that “Puck Power Clash” will not only meet but exceed our stakeholders’ expectations and provide players with an immersive and dynamic gaming environment.

  - Updated our GitHub repository with these documents and linked our active Kanban board.

**Outcome:**  
Our requirements are now clearly defined, with a structured roadmap to guide our upcoming development sprints.
