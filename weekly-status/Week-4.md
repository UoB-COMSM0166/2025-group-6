## Week 4: Requirements, Epics, and User Stories

**Overview:**  
This week, we formalized our project requirements by documenting all necessary elements and planning our future development. We defined our stakeholders, created epics, and developed detailed user stories that outline the vision and functionality of our game.

**Actions Taken:**  
- **Stakeholder Identification:**  
  - Compiled a list of stakeholders (players, designers, developers, testers) and added it to our GitHub requirements section.
- **Epics & User Stories:**  
  - Developed high-level epics (e.g., "basic game mechanics and core game play", "Dynamic Sound Integration", "responsive and advanced graphics") and detailed user stories for core features such as realistic physics, UI responsiveness, and interactive feedback.  
  - Examples include user stories for natural puck collisions and interactive scoring feedback.
- **Reflective Documentation:**  
  - The process of defining epics, user stories, and acceptance criteria has played a crucial role in influencing the development roadmap for “Puck Power Clash.” These agile methods offered a systematic framework that helped our team retain a focused vision while dividing intricate features into achievable tasks. 
    Beginning with epics enabled us to gather overarching requirements from the viewpoints of both the player and the product owner. Epics such as "As a player, I want fundamental game mechanics and essential gameplay" and "As a player, I wish for a completely immersive audio experience" set the groundwork for our game's functional and experiential requirements. Likewise, epics aimed at the product owner—like guaranteeing diverse game screens and comprehensive technical documentation—assisted in clarifying our priorities and stakeholder expectations. 
    Shifting from epics to user stories allowed us to convert these overarching objectives into specific, implementable requirements. User stories offered descriptions that reflected the user's needs within context. For example, the narrative "As a player, I require powerups in the game according to points achieved or winning streaks" enabled us to concentrate on particular gameplay improvements while taking into account their effects on game balance and player engagement. Every user story included acceptance criteria that acted as a checklist to confirm that each feature met the anticipated standards. These standards have directed our development procedure, ensuring that our functionalities are both testable and verifiable. 
    In summary, the creation of epics, user stories, and acceptance criteria has enhanced our team communication and defined our goals, ensuring our development efforts are synchronized with the game’s context. By dividing the project into distinct, prioritized elements, we are more equipped to address challenges efficiently and provide a unified, captivating, and technically sound gaming experience. This organized strategy guarantees that “Puck Power Clash” will not only fulfill but surpass our stakeholders’ expectations, offering players an engaging and vibrant gaming experience. 

  - Updated our GitHub repository with these documents and linked our active Jira board.

**Outcome:**  
Our requirements are now clearly defined, with a structured roadmap to guide our upcoming development sprints.
