## Project Report

### Introduction

- 5% ~250 words
- Describe your game, what is based on, what makes it novel?

### Requirements

- 15% ~750 words
- Use case diagrams, user stories. Early stages design. Ideation process. How did you decide as a team what to develop?
#### 1. Ideation Process

The idea for Puck Power Clash emerged from brainstorming sessions where we explored different concepts for a 2D game. 
Our primary goal was to create a game that is simple to learn but has engaging mechanics to keep players interested. 
We considered various arcade-style games and ultimately chose an air hockey-inspired game because it offers:
- Fast-paced gameplay that keeps players engaged. 
- A well-known concept that can be easily adapted.

Opportunities to introduce novel elements like power-ups and dynamic obstacles and goal posts.

As a team, we debated different features and gameplay mechanics. We used collaborative tools like Miro and Google Docs 
to map out ideas and discuss feasibility. Each team member contributed ideas, and we voted on which mechanics to 
implement in our first version.

#### 2. Early Stages of Design

In the early design phase, we focused on:

- Defining core mechanics: paddle movement, puck physics, and scoring system. 
- Introducing power-ups: speed boost, reverse puck direction, and freeze opponent’s paddle. 
- Adding dynamic obstacles like rotating barriers to increase challenge. 
- Establishing a simple, visually appealing UI using p5.js.

To visualize these concepts, we created rough sketches and flowcharts to represent the game logic. 
We also developed wireframes to define the layout of the game elements on the screen.


##### Paper Prototype

- During the initial design phase, we developed a paper prototype of the game to visualize and test the core gameplay mechanics. 
- This hands-on approach allowed us to simulate player interactions and experiment with different game elements before moving to digital implementation.

#### 3. User Stories
We defined the following user stories to guide development:
As a player, I want to:
- Move my paddle smoothly using keyboard controls so I can intercept the puck. 
- Strike the puck with different angles and speeds to outmaneuver my opponent. 
- Collect power-ups that provide temporary advantages to make gameplay more strategic. 
- Score goals by getting the puck into the opponent’s goal area to win points. 
- Play against a friend in a local multiplayer mode for a competitive experience. 
- Restart the game easily after a match, so I can play multiple rounds without reloading.

#### 4 .Next Steps

With these requirements outlined, our next steps are:
- Developing a prototype to test paddle movement and physics. 
- Implementing core game mechanics before integrating power-ups. 
- Refining UI design and adding visual effects for a polished look. 
- Play-testing to gather feedback and adjust mechanics accordingly.

### Design

- 15% ~750 words
- System architecture. Class diagrams, behavioural diagrams.

### Implementation

- 15% ~750 words

- Describe implementation of your game, in particular highlighting the three areas of challenge in developing your game.

### Evaluation

- 15% ~750 words

- One qualitative evaluation (your choice)

- One quantitative evaluation (of your choice)

- Description of how code was tested.

### Process

- 15% ~750 words

- Teamwork. How did you work together, what tools did you use. Did you have team roles? Reflection on how you worked
  together.

### Conclusion

- 10% ~500 words

- Reflect on project as a whole. Lessons learned. Reflect on challenges. Future work.

### Contribution Statement

- Provide a table of everyone's contribution, which may be used to weight individual grades. We expect that the
  contribution will be split evenly across team-members in most cases. Let us know as soon as possible if there are any
  issues with teamwork as soon as they are apparent.

### Additional Marks

You can delete this section in your own repo, it's just here for information. in addition to the marks above, we will be
marking you on the following two points:

- **Quality** of report writing, presentation, use of figures and visual material (5%)
    - Please write in a clear concise manner suitable for an interested layperson. Write as if this repo was publicly
      available.

- **Documentation** of code (5%)

    - Is your repo clearly organised?
    - Is code well commented throughout?
